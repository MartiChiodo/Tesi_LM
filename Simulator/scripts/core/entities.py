@dataclass
class Workstation:
    """
    Represents the fine-grained state of a workstation.

    A workstation is a picking station on the warehouse perimeter where orders
    are processed. It manages both the orders being processed and the tasks
    (pod assignments) required to fulfill them.

    Attributes
    ----------
    workstation_id : int            Unique identifier of the workstation.
    position : tuple[int, int]      Grid position (x, y) of the workstation on the warehouse perimeter.

    order_capacity : int            Maximum number of simultaneously open (OPEN status) orders.
    opened_orders : set[int]        Order IDs currently in OPEN status.

    released_task_capacity : int    Maximum number of tasks simultaneously in RELEASED status (waiting for robot).
                                    Once a task is assigned to a robot (START_TASK), it no longer counts toward
                                    this limit.
    active_tasks : set[int]         Task IDs currently allocated to robots (in progress at this workstation).

    pod_process_time : float        Time in minutes to process (prepare) a pod at this workstation.
    item_process_time : float       Time in minutes to pick a single item from a pod.

    status : WorkstationPickingStatus   Whether the workstation is IDLE or currently BUSY picking items.
    order_buffer : list[int]            Order IDs queued to be opened when a slot becomes available.
    picking_buffer : list[int]          Task IDs released to released_tasks queue but not yet assigned to robots.
                                        Queued here when workstation is busy (BUSY status).


    Notes
    -----
    Task lifecycle at workstation:
    1. Task released: counted in counter_released_task and added to sim.released_tasks
    2. Task assigned to robot: moved to active_tasks
    3. Task completes picking: removed from active_tasks and counter is decremented
    4. Task has more stops: sent to next workstation
    5. Task done: robot returns pod to storage
